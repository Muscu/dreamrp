-All vehicle installation is done through OpenIV's "Install Package" function. Installation takes less than 30 seconds and is done cleanly in a standalone DLC folder. An uninstaller package is included for easy, clean removal of all vehicles and reversal of all file modifications performed by the installer. All credits for parts/vehicles used are included in this archive in Credits.txt.


-This pack is provided as-is with no form of warranty. All vehicles include ELS style lighting and a variety of extras including pushbars, passenger-side spotlights, dashcams, radar units, and prisoner partitions.  I am not responsible if this pack breaks your game.  Please refer to the OpenIV Installation Package for further information. Report any bugs to me on LCPDFR and I will work to fix them. 


NOTE: If you experience your vehicle lights not working properly, please check other installed vehicle mods for a "carvariations.meta" file and delete any entries for police, police2, police3, police4, police5, or police6.



These files are not to be modified, redistributed, ripped, or otherwise exploited in any way, shape, or form. These files are exclusive to LCPDFR.com and are not to be reuploaded elsewhere. When uploading textures, do not reupload the vehicle models. Upload the textures only and include a link to the original vehicle pack download.
