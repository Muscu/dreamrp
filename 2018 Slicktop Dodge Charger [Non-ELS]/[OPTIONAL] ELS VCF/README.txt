THis is optional but i do recommend it highly


This is an els vcf that can be used to make the vehicle controled by els(turning the light on and off)

it aslo adds wig wags and flashing revesre lights

THIS DOES NOT MAGICALLY MAKE THE VEHICLE ELS THE VEHICLE IS STILL NON-ELS!!!!!!

You will stil NOT be able to control patterns and primary secondary light etc but its easier to use the lights on the vehicle especially if you are using a controler

copy and paste the file at Grand Theft Auto V - ELS - pack_default

assuming you havent changed the path els uses the xmls
